Below are the excellent notes with links to videos from the original author of Oscar. 
I can't find a maintained fork, so I have picked this up. The installer should now run
on any modern Debian Linux. It has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, 18.04, and Raspbian.

To install this version of Oscar, use this command line:

`wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henroFall/oscar/master/install_oscar.sh && sudo chmod +x install_oscar.sh && sudo ./install_oscar.sh`

From the author:
----------------

Oscar automatically adds things to your grocery list when you run out. You
just scan the item's barcode on its way into the trash.

Here's a video about it!

Getting Started: Hardware
-----

I run Oscar on a [Raspberry Pi][raspberry-pi] under [Raspbian][raspbian]. I use
[this barcode scanner][scanner-amazon].

That said, there's no reason Oscar shouldn't work with other hardware.


Getting Started: Software
-----

To install Oscar, run the included `install.py` as root on the target system. It
will walk you through the process of setting up any API accounts you'll need, and
then it'll install the software.

I haven't really tested that install script, so let's cross our fingers together.


Getting Help
-----

I'm [on the Twitters][twitter] if you have a quick question. For bug reports, use
the [issues page][oscar-issues] or submit a pull request.


Acknowledgements

Thanks to the awesome [CloCkWeRX](https://github.com/CloCkWeRX) for picking up my slack
now that I don't have a Raspberry Pi to test on anymore.
